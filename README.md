# Everything

This is the C4C monorepo containing all of our active projects.

Deployable units exist in `/apps`, inside each folder there is a README explaining how that unit is tested and deployed.

Business logic and supporting library for those deployable units exist in `/libs`. These are composable units of software that are not coupled to a specific deployment framework or strategy, and are meant to be easily reused in future projects.

The purpose of `README.md`s in this repository are to explain the usage of the application. The bare minimum you need to get it running. More detailed developer and public documentation exists on the wiki. `README.md`s will often link to relevant wiki pages.

## 🔨 Development
1. Install Node v16.x
2. Clone this repo
3. `yarn install`

When adding new dependencies, use `yarn add` or its dev dependency equivalent. Thanks to Nx, each package will only be installed once, and each app knows how to bundle itself correctly based on its dependencies.
