                Product Designers are the main stakeholders for the design/UI of
                our projects. As a designer, you'll get to work with our
                software developers to create intuitive, user friendly products
                that meet the needs of our non profit partners and their
                members. You'll have the creative freedom to own, iterate, and
                improve the product using the feedback from our product teams
                and partners to achieve a high quality user experience. While
                your journey will start with mock-ups, you will be continuously
                reiterating at different fidelity levels to ensure the designs
                translate to working codable products.
