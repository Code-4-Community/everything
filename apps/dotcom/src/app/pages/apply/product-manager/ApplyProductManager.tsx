                Product Managers at C4C are responsible for scoping out the
                features of our projects, prioritizing developer work, and
                ensuring we're on track to deliver a high quality product at the
                end of the year. Product Managers lead team and client meetings,
                and with the help of our tech leads adjust and optimize the
                team's focus and process. They are the main drivers of our
                initial project specification and help turn that specification
                into actionable and Agile developer tickets.

                A great product manager is someone that is very organized and
                has the foresight to anticipate future challenges. They must be
                an excellent communicator and have the confidence to lead and
                manage a team. Experience writing software is a plus, but
                experience managing any kind of product from start to finish
                will be more applicable. The ideal candidate is passionate about
                bringing projects to life and is excited about empowering a team
                to make an impact in the Boston community.
